    "description": "\n    The museum's prized Ming vase was discovered missing this morning. The display case was still locked, the alarm system was armed, and security cameras show no one entering or leaving the exhibit room between closing time at 6 PM last night and opening at 9 AM today. The only authorized people who entered were the night guard John Smith on his regular rounds at 10 PM, 1 AM, and 4 AM, and the custodian Maria Garcia at 7 AM. The vase was definitely present during the guard's 4 AM check. The security system logs show no alerts or failures.\n\n    The display case itself showed no signs of tampering. The museum director mentioned that a similar vase in the same exhibit was verified as authentic by expert Dr. Li Wei just last week, who remarked on its exceptional quality.\n\n    When questioned, both the guard and custodian claimed they saw nothing unusual. The guard mentioned that he heard some strange noises around 3 AM but attributed them to the building's old heating system.\n    ",
